/// iDraw is a drawing app that demonstrates how to use the PencilKit framework.

/// It shows how you can use PKCanvasView and PKDrawing classes for a great pencil drawing experience,
/// featuring a thumbnail viewer, a drawing canvas with the system tool picker, and a signature pane popover.

/// While PencilKit is optimized for the pencil drawing experience, it also allows users to draw with a finger.
